# Expo Notes

## Create your first app

-   `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process` - temporarily allows scripts in the PowerShell session
-   `reset-project` - script that resets the app directory structure in a project and copies the previous boilerplate files from the project's root directory to another sub-directory called app-example
-   `npx expo start` - when ran in the terminal, it starts the development server and provides a QR code inside the terminal window
    -   Scan that QR code to open the app on a device.
        -   Android:
            1. use the Expo Go
            2. Scan QR code option
        -   iOS: use the default camera app
    -   Run the web app: press 'w' in the terminal
        -   opens the web app in the default web browser
