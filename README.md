# Expo_Tutorial

This project was built by following the official React Native with Expo tutorials: ["Tutorial: Using React Native and Expo"](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/) and ["EAS Tutorial"](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/introduction/). It includes the StickerSmash app, notes on both tutorials, and configured builds for web, Android, and iOS platforms using Expo Application Services (EAS).

## Objective

Get started with Expo, become familiar with the Expo SDK, and gain proficiency with Expo Application Services (EAS) core services: Build, Submit, and Update.

## Topics

### [Tutorial: Using React Native and Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/introduction/)

1. Create an app using the default template with TypeScript enabled
2. Implement a two-screen bottom tabs layout with Expo Router
3. Break down the app layout and implement it with flexbox
4. Use each platform's system UI to select an image from the media library
5. Create a sticker modal using the <Modal> and <FlatList> components from React Native
6. Add touch gestures to interact with a sticker
7. Use third-party libraries to capture a screenshot and save it to the disk
8. Handle platform differences between Android, iOS, and web
9. Finally, go through the process of configuring a status bar, a splash screen, and an icon to complete the app

## [EAS Tutorial](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/eas/introduction/)

1. Use EAS Build to create and install a development build, then run it on a device, emulator, or simulator
2. Experience the benefits of using a development build instead of Expo Go
3. Implement workflows for sharing development builds with a team or external stakeholders
4. Automatically increment app build versions
5. Simultaneously install different app variants, like development and preview, on one device
6. Utilize EAS Update to create and deploy updates swiftly during the development phase
7. Automate build processes by integrating with a GitHub repository
